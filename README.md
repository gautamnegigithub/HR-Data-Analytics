# HR-Data-Analytics
# Project Title: HR Analytics Dashboard | Power BI
# Project Objective
The goal of this project was to build a dynamic, interactive HR analytics dashboard using Power BI to help stakeholders understand attrition patterns and workforce demographics. This dashboard equips HR teams and executives with actionable insights to reduce attrition, optimize hiring strategies, and monitor workforce health.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project comprised structured data in CSV format, containing:

1. Employee demographics (age, gender, education)

2. Department and job role information

3. Salary details

4. Attrition records

5. Years of experience

This data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled using Power Query and DAX in Power BI to allow smooth interactivity and advanced analytics.

# Dashboard Structure
This dashboard was divided into one comprehensive page offering layered insights with filters and slicers for departments.

# Key KPIs Displayed:
Total Employees: 63

Attrition Count: 12

Attrition Rate: 19.0%

Average Age: 38

Average Salary: $6.7K

Average Tenure: 7.2 years

# Attrition Analysis Highlights:

By Education:
Human Resources graduates: 58%

Medical & Technical degrees: Each at 17%

By Age Group:

Highest attrition: 26–35 (8 employees)

Younger & older employees (18–25, 36–45): 2 each

No attrition in 46+ age groups

By Gender:
Female: 6

Male: 5

Others/Unspecified: 1

By Job Role:

Attrition only observed in Human Resources role (12)

Managerial roles showed zero attrition

Salary-Based Insights:

Most attrition occurred at salaries under 5K

Minimal attrition in higher salary bands

Trend Over Time:

Initial peak in attrition, gradually declined

Useful for identifying retention impact of recent HR policies

# Real-World Recommendations:
Focus on retention strategies for employees aged 26–35, a high-risk group.

Evaluate job satisfaction and growth paths for HR roles, which face the most attrition.

Address salary-based dissatisfaction for those earning <5K, possibly via compensation benchmarking.

Leverage trend analysis to assess impact of HR initiatives over time.

# Key Learnings
This project was a deep dive into workforce analytics where I honed my skills in Power BI, including:

Data modeling and Power Query transformations

Writing effective DAX formulas for custom KPIs

Designing a cohesive, insight-driven dashboard layout

Extracting meaningful narratives from raw HR data

It enhanced my ability to translate data into business strategy and gave me a new perspective on the value of HR metrics.
